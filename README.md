# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

* This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.   
* The included R script, run_analysis.R, conducts the following:   
1. Download the dataset from web if it does not already exist in the working directory.        
2. Format training and test data sets.      
3. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.    
4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.   
5. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.      
6. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.   
7. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
